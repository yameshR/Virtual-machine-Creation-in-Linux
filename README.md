 # VIRTUAL MACHINE CREATION IN LINUX
 
 ## AIM
To install a Linux virtual machine (VM) using CentOS on VirtualBox or VMware Workstation.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
This experiment involves setting up a virtual machine with CentOS, a popular Linux distribution. This setup allows users to practice Linux commands, test applications, and develop software in a virtualized environment without affecting the host system.

## ALGORITHM
 ### Step 1:
 Open VirtualBox or VMware Workstation</br>
 
 ### Step 2:
 Go to File -> New to create a new virtual machine.</br>
 
 ### Step 3:
Enter a name for your CentOS VM.Choose Linux as the type and CentOS as the version (or select the closest option available if CentOS is not listed).</br>

 ### Step 4:
 Select the CentOS ISO image you downloaded.</br>
 Set the base memory to 1024 MB (1 GB)</br>
 Allocate 1 processor core </br>
 Set the disk size to at least 20 GB</br>
 Complete the configuration by clicking Finish to create the virtual machine</br>
 
 ### Step 5:
 Select the created VM, go to Details (or Settings), and navigate to the Network tab.</br>
Configure Adapter 1 as NAT (for internet access through the host).</br>
Configure Adapter 2 as Bridged Adapter (for direct access to the local network, if needed).</br>
Click OK to save network settings.</br>

### Step 6:
Click Start to boot up the newly created virtual machine.</br>
During installation, set a password for the root user.</br>
After logging in to CentOS, open a terminal to start using the command line.</br>
